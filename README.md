# Composer-enabled Decoupled Drupal Project

This is Pantheon's recommended starting point for creating new decoupled Drupal 9 backend sites. It builds on Pantheon's default Drupal 9 upstream to provide best practices, default configuration, and accellerator tools for using drupal 9 as a backend in decoupled archictures. 

Unlike with earlier Pantheon upstreams, files such as Drupal Core that you are
unlikely to adjust while building sites are not in the main branch of the 
repository. Instead, they are referenced as dependencies that are installed by
Composer.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome in the form of GitHub pull requests. However, the
`pantheon-upstreams/decoupled-drupal-project` repository is a mirror that does not
directly accept pull requests.

Instead, to propose a change, please fork [pantheon-systems/decoupled-drupal-project](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/decoupled-drupal-project)
and submit a PR to that repository.
